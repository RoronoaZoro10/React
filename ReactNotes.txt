Reacts notes

to set up react app:-
* npm install vite@latest - this code is used to install vite
* npm create vite@latest - with this we can able to create react app
* npm cd folder name - once the app folder is created, get inside the folder
* npm install - this command will install all the dependency required for react
* npm run dev - this command is used to host the website

components-
* every thing in react is considered as component.
* one component can have another component inside it.
* to use a component always, export the component from the component.jsx and import that component.jsx in the component page you want to use.
* inside a return you can't put more than 1 HTML tag. so to put more than one html tag use
    * <div>.....</div>
        or
    * <>........</>
* in a return statement if you want to insert some javascript variable or programs, then use {} to insert the values like variables
and javascript programs.
* even whatever is imported can be used inside the return of the component like{import_name} even images that are been importing.

styles in react-
* there are many methods to style in react
    * first method is styling everything from index.css, but there is some problem in this method. it will apply for all the html present in 
    react components.
    * second method is know as module method, where the components where created in a folder and the components.jsx and css_stylesheet will
    be placed in that folder. need to import the style_sheet in the components.jsx. once imported it will be placed in{style.ClassName} .
    * third method is inline method. where the style will be written inside the components.jsx itself.

props-
* using using we can pass the values as the arugments to components. by using props we can give different values for components to display.
* if no arugments were passed to components. default components can be set. so when there is no prop arugment present, default values will be
passed.
